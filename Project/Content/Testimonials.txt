"Just wanted to inform that we received our order a couple of days ago and all seems to be in order. Part and detail quality is good and we couldn't find any defects.
We were particularly impressed with your Polypropylene -like material, Endur. It's much friendlier for simulation of plastic parts and snaps than other materials we worked with before."
